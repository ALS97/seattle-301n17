# SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Overview

Today we will be covering some new topics and reviewing concepts you should already be familiar with. For students who completed Code 201, today should be a review of CSS floats.

We will spend some time reviewing the concepts from the lab 00 assignments. We will also discuss several new and very important topics, including state, scope, and the "new" keyword.

## Learning Objectives

As as result of completing Lecture 1 of Code 301, students will:

- Gain an understanding of scope with arrow functions and with the use of `let` and `const` in place of `var`
- Gain an understanding of context, scope, "this", and the "new" keyword
- Refresh their understanding of CSS floats

## Cloning Our Class Repo

- Visit your class repository in a browser (link can be found in your course syllabus)
- **Fork the class repository** by clicking the "Fork" button on the repo page in github.
- Once you do this, you'll have your own "copy" of the repo
- **Clone the repository**
  - On your local machine, create a `301` folder under your current `codefellows` folder
  - Create your clone within this folder
  - Note: Your future 301 lab assignments will also be done here
- **Set the class repository as your `upstream`**
  - `cd` into your cloned repo and type this command:
  - `git remote add upstream CLASS-REPO-URL`
    - Replace CLASS-REPO-URL with the actual URL to the class repository, not your fork.
- From this point on, when your instructor commits changes to the class repository, you can pull those changes into your fork with this command, from within your folder
  - `git pull upstream master`

### Why are we doing this?

- You may elect to use the Wiki or Issues features to enhance your experience
- You may want to add your own notes or code to the class days in addition to what your instructor posts.
- Maintaining your own fork allows you to keep connected to the class "master" repository, while still being able to make changes to your version or fork of it.
